# binary_to_text
Basically a binary translator. Every character in the alphabet has its corresponding 8 bit code. (the code for an uppercase letter is different from its lowercase form)
The words are separated with an underscore. (_) Every other puncuation is the same as you would use it in text. (.!?,;)
